# dm-icons
This web icon font set was originally based on driftyco/ionicons. Sizing and style changes have been made to all icons. New icons have also been added and many unused fonts have been removed.

## Example usage on a webpage with CSS already loaded

<i class="icon dm-arrow-forward" aria-hidden="true"></i>

Note: Please use `aria-hidden="true"` when using icons for decoration purposes.
